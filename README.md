laravel-pjax
======
**laravel-pjax** is a pjax middleware for Laravel >5.1.

By adding [pjax](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax) & jQuery to your web application, ajax and pushState can be used to deliver a fast browsing experience with real permalinks, page titles, and a working back button.

This middleware adds some functionality that other middleware (at the time of writing) did not provide, such as container whitelists and faster page filtering.

I wanted to have some additional functionality for loading "pjax" AJAX requests, so I quickly threw together this package.
